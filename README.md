# purpose

This app is all about fun. Originally, it was a gift for my girlfriend, who's a huge fan. While brainstorming how to design it and which programming language would be most suitable, I stumbled upon a development called desktop-cat-cursor by Samperson. Equally absurd, but since the goal wasn't to reinvent the wheel, I decided to breathe new life into their old project using C#, adding a touch of aesthetics without losing its original purpose.

## How it Works:

First, the design logic:

- It creates two desktop shortcuts: one for launching the mods and another for exiting the application.
- It generates a log file to track events in case of errors.
- It can be uninstalled from the system's root, but admin permissions might be needed.
- Additional memes, sounds, or notes can be added by copying them to the default path: `C:\Program Files (x86)\DesktopGoose v0.31\Assets\*`.

### App Functionality Menu

When you get tired and want to stop the app, run the application called GoodBye.exe, which will terminate the app without any complications.
